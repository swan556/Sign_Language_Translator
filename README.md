# ASL Alphabet Recognition using TensorFlow

This project is a deep learning-based American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognition system that detects letters based on hand gestures. Built with TensorFlow, it classifies images of hand signs into corresponding alphabets.

## Features
- Real-time ASL alphabet recognition using a trained deep learning model.
- Supports classification of all 26 alphabets in ASL.
- Easily expandable with more data for improved accuracy.
- Includes image references for different gestures.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
