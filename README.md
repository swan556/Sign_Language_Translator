# ASL Alphabet Recognition using TensorFlow

This project is a deep learning-based ASL alphabet recognition system that detects letters based on hand gestures. Built with TensorFlow, it classifies images of hand signs into corresponding alphabets.

## Features
- Uses a trained deep learning model for real-time ASL alphabet recognition.
- Supports classification of all 26 alphabets in ASL.
- Can be expanded with more data for better accuracy.
- Image references for different gestures (https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/584462/04-28-signlanguage-01.jpg).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/swan556/Sign_Language_Translator.git
   cd Sign_Language_Translator
